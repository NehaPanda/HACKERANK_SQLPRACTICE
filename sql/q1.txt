Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates?

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE UPPER(SUBSTR(CITY, -1)) IN ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');
So, for example:

If the city name is "San Francisco", the last character is 'o', which will be converted to 'O' for the comparison.
If the city name is "Hawaii", the last character is 'i', which will be converted to 'I'.
